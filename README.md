# Elderise – Elderly-Friendly Learning Platform

Elderise is a front-end concept for an elderly-friendly e-learning platform, originally created as an idea submission for a hackathon event.  
The project focuses on building accessible user interfaces and designing a simple, supportive learning experience tailored for senior users.
